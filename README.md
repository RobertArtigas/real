**The dreamstate, your dreamstate,** is not intelligent, it is intelligence. 
That’s what it means to say thoughts are things. That’s the integration that occurs when we overcome the false segregation between self and environment. 
There are no particles or atoms or building blocks, there is no time, space, energy or matter, there is only intelligence. 
All appearance -- clouds, feelings, bananas, beliefs, self, toothpaste -- is intelligence and nothing else. <BR/>
